Metrics
=======

Routinator's :ref:`monitoring service <doc_routinator_monitoring>` provides 
comprehensive metrics in two formats:

 - JSON format at the :command:`/api/v1/status` endpoint
 - Prometheus format at the :command:`/metrics` endpoint
 
Here you can find an overview of all metrics and their meaning.
