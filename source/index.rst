Routinator 3000 is free, open source RPKI Relying Party software written by
`NLnet Labs <https://nlnetlabs.nl>`_ in the `Rust programming language
<https://www.rust-lang.org>`_.

The application is designed to be lightweight and have great portability. This
means it can run on any Unix-like operating system, but also works on Microsoft
Windows. Due to its lean design, it can run effortlessly on minimalist hardware
such as a Raspberry Pi. 

Routinator connects to the Trust Anchors of the five Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs) — APNIC, AFRINIC, ARIN, LACNIC and RIPE NCC — downloads all of
the certificates and ROAs in the various repositories, verifies the signatures
and makes the result available for use in the BGP workflow. 

It is a full featured software package that can perform RPKI validation as a
one-time operation and store the result on disk in formats such as CSV, JSON and
RPSL, or run as a service that periodically downloads and verifies RPKI data.
Routers can connect to Routinator to fetch verified RPKI data via the RTR
protocol. The built-in HTTP server offers a user interface and endpoints for the
various file  formats, as well as logging, status and Prometheus monitoring.
