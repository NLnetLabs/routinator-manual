Monitoring
==========

The HTTP server in Routinator provides endpoints for monitoring the application.
To launch Routinator in server mode on 192.0.2.13 with RTR running on port 3323
and HTTP on 8323, use the following command:

.. code-block:: text

   routinator server --rtr 192.0.2.13:3323 --http 192.0.2.13:8323

The HTTP service has these monitoring endpoints on the following paths:

:command:`/version`
    Returns the version of the Routinator instance

:command:`/metrics`
    Exposes exhaustive time series data specifically for `Prometheus
    <https://prometheus.io/>`_, containing metrics on all trust anchors,
    repositories, RRDP and rsync connections, as well as RTR and HTTP sessions.
    If desired, dedicated `port 9556
    <https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations>`_
    is allocated for the exporter.
     
:command:`/api/v1/status`
    Returns exhaustive information in JSON format on all trust anchors,
    repositories, RRDP and rsync connections, as well as RTR and HTTP sessions.
    This data set provides the source for the Routinator user interface.

:command:`/status`
    Returns a subset of the metrics information in a concise plain text format

Metrics
-------

Update metrics
  - When the last update started and finished
  - The total duration of the last update
  - The retrieval duration and `exit code <https://lxadm.com/Rsync_exit_codes>`_ for each rsync publication point
  - The retrieval duration and `HTTP status code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes>`_ for each RRDP publication point 

Object metrics
  - For each cryptographic object that can appear in the RPKI, the number of valid, invalid and stale items per trust anchor and repository
  - The number of validated ROA payloads (VRPs) per Trust Anchor and repository
  - The number of VRPs added and excluded locally

RTR server
  - The current RTR serial number
  - The current number of RTR connections
  - The total amount of bytes sent and received over the RTR connection
  - Metrics for each RTR client is available if the :option:`--rtr-client-metrics` option is provided
  
HTTP server
  - The current number of HTTP connections
  - The total amount of bytes sent and received over the HTTP connection
  - The number of HTTP requests

JSON
""""

At the :command:`/api/v1/status` endpoint the following JSON key value pairs
are available:

``version``
    The version of Routinator
    
``serial``
    The current :ref:`RTR <doc_routinator_rtr_service>` serial number
    
``now``
    The current date and time in UTC
    
``lastUpdateStart``
    The date and time time in UTC that the last validation run started

    The date and time time in UTC that the last validation run completed
    
``lastUpdateDuration``
    The duration of the last validation run, in seconds
    
``tals``
    Metrics for each configured trust anchor. In most cases these will be the
    five Regional Internet Registries, but will include the trust anchors of
    any configured :ref:`testbeds <doc_routinator_testbed>` as well.
    
``vrpsTotal``
    The total number of Validated ROA Payloads (VRPs) found to be present and

``vrpsDuplicate``
    The number of duplicate VRPs resulting from ROAs containing the same 
    authorisation

``vrpsFinal``
    The number of VRPs that is considered the final set provided to your 
    routers. It is the total number of VRPs, minus the ones that are unsafe,
    locally filtered and duplicate.

    lists <Certificate  Revocation List (CRL)>`

``strayCRLs``
    The number of stray :term:`certificate revocation lists <Certificate

    valid

``validEECerts``
    The number of End Entity certificates found to be present and valid

Grafana
-------

Using the Prometheus endpoint it's possible to build a detailed dashboard using
for example `Grafana <https://grafana.com>`_. We provide a `template
<https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11922>`_ to get started.
